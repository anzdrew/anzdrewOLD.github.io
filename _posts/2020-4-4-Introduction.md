<!--- Welcome to my new and improved website, made using Github Pages and Jekyll.  
My webdev experience has basically consisted of one Udemy course so far, so expect this site to break sometimes.  
I'll be posting interesting things I find and learn about information security, social engineering and business.  -->

<!--- Also I'm a huge fan of the Vaporwave aesthetic so once I figure some stuff out expect a hella nice theme.  
For whatever reason you want to contact me, connect on LinkedIn and mention this site in the message.  -->


<!--- The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. -->
